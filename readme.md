I started my career by obtaining certifications as a Computer Networks Technician in the state of Cear√°. Although this specialization was not practiced professionally, over the years as a Programmer, I have had the privilege of contributing to projects that positively impacted the lives of thousands of people, demonstrating my ability to deliver efficient solutions.

I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at [UNIFOR University of Fortaleza](https://www.unifor.br/). I play a role on both sides of development, being proficient in various programming languages and technologies, which contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of systems development.
