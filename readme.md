I began my journey by obtaining certifications as a Computer Network Technician in the state of Cear√°. Although this specialization was not professionally practiced, over the years, as a Junior Programmer, I had the privilege of integrating projects that had a positive impact on the lives of thousands of people, demonstrating my ability in efficient solutions.

Currently, I am graduating in Systems Analysis and Development at [Unifor](https://www.unifor.br/), with a focus on Back-end. However, I possess versatile skills that allow me to play a role on both sides, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of system development.
